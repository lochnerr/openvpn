# Sign a csr (certificate signing request) for an OpenVPN server or client.

# This generates a client or server certificate and creates a tar file that contains the certificate, 
# the ca certificate and the TLS auth key. Additionally, for servers, a jail sub-directory and
# a certificate revocation list are created and included in the tar file.  These are all of the
# files necessary for a client or server to operate (in addition to their respective private keys).
